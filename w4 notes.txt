structures are predecessors to classes(anni - star wars ref)
useful for just for data -keep local

struct car
{
	string make;
	string model;
	double liters;
	Bool Automatic;
}

car temp = newcar();
car.make = "Honda";
car.model = "Civic";
Console.WriteLine("Make is" + car.make);
---- public vars----






classes (luke/rey)
functionality
can also have functions built in; "methods"


class car
{
	public string make;
	public string model;
	public double liters;
	public bool automatic;
	public int speed = 0;	-- changed "public" to "private:
	public accel(int speedupby)
		{
		speed += speedupby;
		}
	public decel (int slowdownby)
		{
		speed = slowdownby;
		}
	public setspeed (int myspeed)
		{
		speed = myspeed;
		}

}


set and get capability
